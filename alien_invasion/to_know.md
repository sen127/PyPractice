How the classes and everything else is stored in 01

What really happens in the chip when instances are created

Difference between instances and a object
    Both are same object = instance
    Class is a blueprint and object is the actual thing created from it

Difference between method and a function
    Functions are standalones
    Methods are functions attached to a class, using self

Logic of passing self in a method
    So the method knows which object data to use

Why _functionname syntax
    _init_ or _str_ --> dunder methods, are built in features, magic methods reserved by python
    _name --> internal not imported, soft private methods

What is a string literal and a tuple?
